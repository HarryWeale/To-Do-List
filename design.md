### Design Decisions
TODO: (Add Screens for each of these design decisions)
- Add Task Button
    - Moved to the bottom of the screen, close to where the user’s thumbs will be for easier time adding new tasks
    - After selecting the Add Task button, the “Add Task Button” goes away: Keyboard is open and user can submit the “Return” or “Done” button on the phone to submit the task
- “Complete Task success popup,” “Edit Task success popup,” “Delete Task success popup”
    - Added this confirmation feature so that users can get feedback that the program is working as intended
    - Moved to top because thumb-area/bottom of screen is focused on “Adding New Tasks”
    - Added Undo Button to provide flexibility for the user in case they wish to undo their actions
- When editing a task:
    - Decided against highlighting the entire task
        - We decided that Having the text auto populate in the “Edit Task” text field is sufficient for the user to understand which task they are actively editing
        - Keyboard pops up also helps user know they are actively editing their to-do list/selected task
- Delete Tasks
    - Made selecting the “X” button Red
- Ordering of the “Complete,” “Edit” and “Delete” buttons
    - Rearranged order from “Complete, Delete, Edit” to “Complete, Edit, Delete” to add a natural barrier between the “Complete” (positive task) and “Delete” (never completed, no longer relevant, negative connotation) 


### lternative designs you considered, including images
TODO: (Add Screenshots from the whiteboards when we were drawing, + reasons why we didn't do those)
- Images from the board
### Sentiments (user interviews)
  - User tested the white border for the submit button
    - Users preferred the white border – reminded them of highway signs
  - User tested the lack of borders around the complete, edit, and delete buttons
    - Wasn’t a problem, users knew to press these button
